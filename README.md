Foreword

First, thanks for making the time for this challenge! We really appreciate it.
Challenge - Star Wars
What should you build?
Design a small React app that shows a list of characters using the api SWAPI (https://swapi.co). This list should have a traditional pager or a scrolling pager, you decide. Add the ability to navigate the list filtering by race, character, planets and starships. When an item is clicked, show the details of it.
Also, create another section called "My Galactic League" where the user can add:

3 Races
6 Characters
2 Planets
3 Starships

My Galactic League must have at least one character of the 3 selected races. And only characters of the selected races can be added.
The items on "My Galactic League" can be added or deleted always respecting the maximum and restrictions commented before.
For saving the data of "My Galactic League" use something local, may be cookies, local storage or something else. But don't use anything on the server side.

Notes

Tests are important (unit, integration, end to end). Add the tests you prefer.
Add a README with everything you consider necessary to run the app
Do not develope any backend code
If you make any assumptions, take note of them in the README, so we can better understand your decisions.
We are open for questions if you have any doubts
